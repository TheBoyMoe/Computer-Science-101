## Overview

 * Declarative knowledge - statement of fact
 * Imperative knowledge 
    - is a 'how to'
    - a recipe - a sequence of steps which specifies when each step should be executed (flow control)
               - a means of determining when to stop.
    - each step is built from a set of predefined primitive instructions
        - arithmetic (+,-.*,/, %) & logic operations
        - simple tests (is a == b, etc)
        - storing/moving data
 * Turing showed that you could compute anything using the [Turing Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJQTFhkhwPA&feature=youtu.be) and [6 basic operations(primitives)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28148562/what-are-the-six-basic-primitives-in-turing-complete)
        - move left, right, print(write to cell), scan(read cell contents), erase and halt(do nothing).
 * A programming language provides a set of primitives (strings, booleans, numbers, etc) & operations (+,/, *, etc), which are used to build expressions
